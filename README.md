This repository includes the codes and information used to develop a **PostgreSQL Database** that contains studies on feeding ecology of wolf across its distribution range. The database is Open Access and is available for use under the term of the Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, see Full License below). The aim is to encourage researchers to engage in data collection, foster collaboration, and emphasize the knowledge about wolf foraging habits. Scientists from Romania, Italy and the Netherlands (_Corradini, A., De Groeve, J., van Loon, E., Sin, T., Gazzola, A._) are currently working together to create the database.

Any researcher interested in collaborating could directly contact the authors via GitHub or email _worldwolfdiet@gmail.com_  

The repository is divided in subdirectories:  

* **[bibliography](https://github.com/andreacorra/WolfDiet/tree/master/bibliography)**: List of publications currently reviewed and added to database;
* **[code](https://github.com/andreacorra/WolfDiet/tree/master/code)**: List of scripts used to build the database and import the diet studies, as well as the R package workflow used to download the data via R.
* **[data](https://github.com/andreacorra/WolfDiet/tree/master/data)**: The **wolfdiet** data downloadable in four different file formats:
  * [R](https://github.com/andreacorra/wolfdiet/raw/master/data/wolfdiet_R/wolfdiet.zip) package of the wolfdiet data view - see [here](https://github.com/andreacorra/wolfdiet/tree/master/data/wolfdiet_R) for installation instructions.  
  * [csv](https://github.com/andreacorra/wolfdiet/raw/master/data/wolfdiet_csv) version of the wolfdiet data view.
  * [psql](https://github.com/andreacorra/wolfdiet/raw/master/data/wolfdiet_psql/wolfdiet_0-2-0.backup) version of the wolfdiet database - see [here](https://github.com/andreacorra/wolfdiet/tree/master/data/wolfdiet_psql) for installation instructions.  
  * [sqlite](https://github.com/andreacorra/wolfdiet/raw/master/data/wolfdiet_sqlite/wolfdiet.sqlite) version of the wolfdiet database.
